This code calculates the algorithm explained in the following article:
"A Bellman-Ford algorithm for the path-length-weighted distance in graphs"

The PathLengthWeightdistanceAlg_Class.py file is the code created in Python where the graph is created by a class that allows to calculate the path-length-weight distance. It also contains a function that calculates the distance of the entire graph (from all nodes to all nodes).
