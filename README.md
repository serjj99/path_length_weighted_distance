This code calculates the algorithm explained in the following article:
"A Bellman-Ford algorithm for the path-length-weighted distance in graphs"

The PathLengthWeightdistanceAlg_Class.py file is the code created in Python where the graph is created by a class that allows to calculate the path-length-weight distance. It also contains a function that calculates the distance of the entire graph (from all nodes to all nodes). To use this class you only need the 'numpy' library.

The user can directly run the Example.py file. In this file a graph is created using the PathLengthWeightdistanceAlg_Class.py class, calculates the distance of the graph and displays it using the 'networkx' and 'matplotlib' libraries.
